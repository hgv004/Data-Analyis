Hello! I'm Hardik Vaghela, a seasoned Data Analyst with over 3 years of hands-on experience in Power BI, SQL, Tableau, Looker, and Python.  I specialize in data analysis, visualization, and warehousing, ensuring businesses derive actionable insights from their data.

My expertise lies in various aspects of data management, including data integration, profiling, security, and modeling. I'm adept at utilizing Python scripting for ETL pipelines and exploratory data analysis, alongside employing tools like Power Query, DAX, SQL, and Excel for robust data analysis.

In my previous roles, I successfully delivered multiple Power BI projects tailored to clients' needs, securing additional projects through exceptional performance. My ability to adapt quickly to new tools and implement advanced data transformation techniques resulted in significant improvements in project delivery time and client satisfaction.
